This is the official repository and backup location for the UBank Project.

## About
I started the UBank project to learn how to make a bank demo using html, css & javascript (for the frontend) and PHP & mysql (for the backend).<br>
To host this project, but keep it offline I used Ampps for the Apache webserver & MySQL for the databases and the PHPMyAdmin console.<br>
Every new update contains a newer version of this project with bug fixes, new functions and/or remodels.<br>
The databases will be included in the backups too (in case the database configuration got updated in an update.)

## Installation
<i>Coming soon after the Big Remake (new release).</i>

## Credits
In this project I used the following resources:
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) (For style attributes & javascript elements),
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) (For the awesome icons),
- [Fake logos](https://github.com/pigment/fake-logos) (As it says, fake logos for the business partners section)
