# About
I started the UBank project to learn how to make a bank demo using html, css & javascript (for the frontend) and PHP & mysql (for the backend).<br>
To host this project, but keep it offline I used Ampps for the Apache webserver & MySQL for the databases and the PHPMyAdmin console.<br>
Every new update contains a newer version of this project with bug fixes, new functions and/or remodels.<br>
The databases will be included in the backups too (in case the database configuration got updated in an update.)

# When making a backup...
1. First export database configuration file (ie. UBankDB.sql) and if more databases present include them too.
2. Modify this README.md file with the information of the upload below (Change the commit counter too!!).
3. Include the domains (mainly ubank.me & account.ubank.me).<br>
<b>REMEMBER:</b> The backup exists of the two home folders of 'ubank.me' and 'account.ubank.me'. <br>If a new
subdomain will be present, include it in the next version of the backup.

# Installation
<i>Coming soon after the Big Remake (new release).</i>
