My TODO list for this project:

2. Make a create account request page that will be shown to the admin to make an account for a new user (DOING)

Done:
3. Changed the date's on all pages to responsive (using php echo)
1. Make the page 100% of the width and not bigger
4. Add new pages where more information can be found (faq.php --> difference current & savings account) (Done!, about, faq, contact)
6. make a question respond system: (DONE!)
	- link form on ubank.me/contact with contact-process.php, which will add the questions to new table 'questions' in UBankDAT db.
	- database structure: id (AUTO_INCREMENT), first name & last name, email address, question type, message, status (not read/done),
		read_by (which staff marked it as done, first empty at 'done' then add staff name)
	- staff can see the questions and delete them if trash/mark them as done when 'mailed' customer back. 
	- staff page: questions.php, 2 sections: 'incoming questions (2 buttons: delete question (red), done question (green))' and 
		'done' section with questions that are 'mailed back to' and ready to be archived.
	- MAYBE add status at 'DONE' with information about who (Staff) marked it done'

## Ideas:
5. Add auto scrolling partner bar on homepage and other pages
