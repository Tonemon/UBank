My TODO list for this project:
## TODO (NEXT YEAR):
- clean code (remove unnecessary comments and make sure tabs look normal).
- Change some of the mechanisms to make it more unique (like mysql tables, php code, etc.).
- Add icons to buttons (using the <button> instead of input submit type)!
- Add logout message on index screen and other messages
- Let users change their password (terminate session after change)
- Let admins change account status from active to disabled and the user will be logged out and will see the message: 'Your account is disabled. Please contact support for more information'.
- Let users change username (add select button to choose to change username, password or other info in settings).
- Add all the -process.php files in the header of a file like 'edit' and use the 'if isset' way.


## Done:
2. Fix the last login counter for staff members (was displaying 00-00-0000 00:00).
5. Remove the errors staff members/admin gets when deleting a user!!! ITEM 12 (using javascript redirect)
3. Add popup with info when 'forgot password' is clicked (all users).
7. Add the error message when password is wrong (all users, ?error=1).
12. Change all the fake popup's to real (bootstrap alerts):
 - login right/wrong (done, all users)
 - change password (done, all users)
 - add/delete contacts (done, customer)
 - request atm/check (done, customer)
 - create/edit/delete customer/staff member (done, admin)
	-- Created error! cannot get header information --> fixed with javascript redirect
13. Add option to add/delete admin members, but page only accessible to admin with ID 1 (the owner) (done, admin)
X. Changed footer to responsive with date updating
14. BUG! when admin is changing contact information the mobile number changes in the email addres of the edited user
	(fixed! + admin can change customer & staff email).
1! Make the icons on the pages goto the background, so everything in front will be clickable (Fixed! made icons smaller in the corner).
9. Change ATM/Checkquebook to different cards, like Mastercard, Visa Card, Creditcard, etc. (make 3 tables, starting with req_*).
19. Change table 'beneficiary1' to 'contacts' (phpmyadmin)
20. Customer: Change the current branches (Kolkata, Delhi) to countries (NL, EN, US) (Done!)
21. Make the Ifsc codes random (by adding a randomnumber variable between 1 & 9) (Done!)
17. Staff: Make buttons above page to only see 1 of the 4 request sections (show contacts always, hide other 3) (DONE!)
18. Staff: Add deny request button, which changes status to 'DENIED'. After users can make a new request. (DONE!)
    Staff: Add delete request button, which changes status to nothing. After users can make a new request. (DONE!)
22. Make a create account request page that will be shown to the admin to make an account for a new user (DONE)
	- make two sections (like staff has for requests) with 'new customers' & 'existing customers'
	- new customers section will show new customers form and requests via website.
	- admin will see the account request and if accepted it will create a passbook$id and delete record from customernew table

## Ideas:
4. MAYBE Let staff members login the same way as the admin (using username instead of email).
11. MAYBE add the magical cookie to get 100$ and let it say in the description: "You sneaky bastard..."
15. MAYBE Make the 'Search for...' bar in the header (all) working. Process & output in search.php. Customers can search for their 
	transactions, staff can search for requests, admin's can search for users & staff.
16. Staff: make a counter at the homescreen showing how many pending requests/contact there are at the moment
